# Tenuki - Go elsewhere, to the terminal

**Tenuki** is a terminal-based OGS ([Online-Go Server](https://online-go.com))
client built with Go and the [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) UI library.
It lets you escape the browser and enjoy your correspondence games right from
your favorite terminal.
